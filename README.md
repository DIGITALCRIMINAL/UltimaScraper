#For Apple Mac users -
macOS uses a older version of python by default so you will need to have a newer version installed on your device. Download and install the following version 
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-macosx10.9.pkg if required, as this is a known working version. Once the newer version of python is installed, you can create aliases for python however for the sake of this tutorial simply use 'python3.8' and 'pip3' for the commands below.



# Mandatory Tutorial

Read the [#FAQ](README.md#faq) at the bottom of this page before submitting a issue.

Mac Users- 
Open Terminal and type 'cd /PATH/TO/ONLYFANSFOLER' example 'cd ~/Downloads/OnlyFans-5.5'
then run the commands below.


From the project folder open CMD/Terminal and run the command below:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Apple mac users try 'pip3' instead of 'pip'


Start:

`python start_ofd.py` or double click `start_ofd.py`

Apple mac users try 'python3.8' instead of 'python'


Open and edit:

`config.json`

[auth]

Fill in the following:

- `{"auth_id":"your_auth_id"}`
- `{"sess":"your_sess_token"}`
- `{"user-agent":"your_user-agent"}`

If you're using 2FA or have these cookies:

- `{"auth_hash":"your_auth_hash"}`
- `{"auth_uniq_":"your_auth_uniq_"}`

Optional change:

- `{"fp":"your_fp"}`
- `{"app-token":"your_token"}`

Only enter in cookies that reflect your OnlyFans account otherwise, you'll get auth errors.

Go to www.onlyfans.com and login, open the network debugger, then check the image below on how to get said above cookies

Your auth config should look similar to this
